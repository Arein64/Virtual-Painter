# Virtual-Painter
This project uses opencv and mediapipe to create a virtual painting tool. It tracks a person's index finger through their webcam. The person's finger is tracked and it's movements are copied onto another frame. When the user wants to save their painting, they can quit running their webcam, and their painting will automatically get saved.

To run this project, Pip install mediapipe and use python version 3.11 or under.

When you are done running the file, press q to exit the webcam window, and your painting will automatically get saved.
